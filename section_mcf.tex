\section{Mean curvature flow}

Mean curvature flow describes the geometric evolution of a set $ ( \Omega ( t ) )_{ t \geq 0 } $ respectively the evolution of its boundary $ \Sigma ( t ) \coloneqq \partial \Omega ( t ) $. It is described by the equation
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{ 1 }{ \mu } V = - \sigma H 
	\quad
	\text{on }
	\Sigma.
\end{equation*}
There are a lot of different notions of solutions to this equation(HIER EINFÃœGEN).
For us the central structure of this equation is its gradient flow structure.
