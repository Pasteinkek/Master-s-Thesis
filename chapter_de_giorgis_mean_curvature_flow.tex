\chapter{De Giorgi's mean curvature flow}

In this chapter, we build on the results of the previous chapter and introduce 
a different solution concept for mean curvature flow, namely a De Giorgi type $ 
\bv 
$-solution to mean curvature. A similar solution concept has been introduced in 
\cite[Def.~1]{laux_lelmi_de_giorgis_inequality_for_the_threshholding_scheme}, 
but in the context of convergence of the thresholding scheme to mean curvature 
flow. Moreover, we will also compare it to the solution concept 
\cite[Def.~1]{hensel_laux_varifold_solution_concept_for_mean_curvature_flow}, 
which instead of using functions of bounded variation also permits the more 
general varifolds to be solutions to mean curvature flow.
