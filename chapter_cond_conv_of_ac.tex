\chapter{Convergence to an evolving partition}
\label{chapter_convergence_to_evolving_partition}

The main content of this chapter is to look at the behaviour of solutions of 
the Allen--Cahn equation (\ref{allen_cahn_eq}) as the parameter $ \varepsilon $ 
tends to zero with minimal assumptions. As it turns out the scalar case is 
significantly easier to handle than the vectorial case, thus we shall first 
focus on the case $ N = 1 $ and $ P = 2 $,
also called the \emph{two-phase case}. We will show that as $ \varepsilon $ 
tends to zero, $ u_{ \varepsilon } $ converges to an evolving partition of the 
flat torus which only takes values in the zeros of the potential $ W $.
