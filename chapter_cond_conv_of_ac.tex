\chapter{Conditional convergence of the Allen--Cahn equations}

The main content of this chapter is to look at the behaviour of solutions of the Allen--Cahn equation (\ref{allen_cahn_eq}) as the parameter $ \varepsilon $ tends to zero. As it turns out the scalar case is significantly easier to handle than the vectorial case, thus we shall first focus on the case $ N = 1 $,
also called the \emph{twophase case}.
