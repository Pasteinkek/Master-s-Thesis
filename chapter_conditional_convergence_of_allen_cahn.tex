\chapter{Conditional convergence of the Allen--Cahn equation}
\label{chapter_conditional_convergence_of_ac}

This chapter is dedicated to the main conditional convergence result by Laux 
and Simon 
\cite{convergence_of_allen_cahn_equation_to_multiphase_mean_curvature_flow}.
We will assume that for almost every time, the 
Cahn--Hilliard energies of the solutions of the Allen--Cahn equation converge 
to the surface tension energy of the limit. Then we can show that the limit is 
a $ \bv 
$-solution to mean curvature flow in the sense of \Cref{motion_by_mcv} for the 
two-phase case and \Cref{motion_by_mmcf} for its multiphase equivalent.

The proofs we present are taken from 
\cite{convergence_of_allen_cahn_equation_to_multiphase_mean_curvature_flow}, 
or from other authors, 
in which case we explicitly credit them. At some points however, arguments 
in the original proofs are missing, which we provide here.

Since the arguments are again quite involved, we shall first focus on the 
easier 
two-phase case and then turn towards the multiphase case.
