\chapter{Conditional convergence of the Allen--Cahn equation}
\label{chapter_conditional_convergence_of_ac}

This chapter is dedicated to the main conditional convergence results by Laux 
and Simon 
\cite{convergence_of_allen_cahn_equation_to_multiphase_mean_curvature_flow}.
The goal is to show that under the assumption that for almost every time, the 
Cahn--Hilliard energies of the solutions of the Allen--Cahn equation converge 
to the surface tension energy of the limit, we have that the limit is a $ \bv 
$-solution to mean curvature flow in the sense of \Cref{motion_by_mcv} for the 
two-phase case and \Cref{motion_by_mmcf} for its multiphase equivalent.

The proofs we present are taken from 
\cite{convergence_of_allen_cahn_equation_to_multiphase_mean_curvature_flow}, 
or from other authors, 
in which case we explicitly credit them. At some points however, some arguments 
in the original proofs are missing, which we then complete and also point this 
out to the reader.

Since the arguments are again quite involved, we shall focus on the easier 
two-phase case first and then turn towards the multiphase case.
