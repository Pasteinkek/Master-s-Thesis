\section{Gradient flows}
	\label{section_gradient_flows}
In the simplest case, a gradient flow of a given energy $ \energy \colon 
\mathbb{ R }^{ N } \to \mathbb{ R } $ (with respect to the Euclidean inner 
product) is a solution to the ordinary differential equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{gf_basic_equation}
	\dv{ t } x ( t ) = - \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) ,
\end{equation}
where we usually prescribe some initial value $ x ( 0 ) = x_{ 0 } \in \mathbb{ 
R }^{ N } $. The central structure here is that on the right hand side of the 
equation, we do not have an arbitrary vector field, but the gradient of some 
continuously 
differentiable function. Remember that the gradient of a function always 
depends on the chosen metric of our space. In fact, the gradient $ \nabla 
\energy ( x ) $ is always the unique element of the tangent space at $ x $ 
which 
satisfies
\begin{equation*}
	\inner*{ \nabla \energy ( x ) }{ y }
	=
	\dd_{ x } \energy ( y ) 
\end{equation*}
for all elements $ y $ in the tangent space at $ x $. In our setting, the 
tangent space at any point is exactly $ \mathbb{ R }^{ N } $.  

A solution $ x $ moves in the 
direction of the steepest descent of the energy $ \energy $. Moreover this 
allows for the following computation given a continuously differentiable 
solution $ x $ of (\ref{gf_basic_equation}):
\begin{align*}
	\dv{ t } \energy ( x ( t ) ) 
	& =
	\inner*{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }{ x ' ( t ) }
	=
	- \abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	=
	- \abs{ x' ( t ) }^{ 2 }
	\\
	& =
	- \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\left(
		\abs{ x'( t ) }^{ 2 }
		+
		\abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	\right).
\end{align*}
We especially obtain that the function $ \energy ( x ( t ) ) $ is 
non-increasing, which coincides with our intuition of the steepest descent. But 
more precisely, we obtain from the 
fundamental theorem of calculus the \emph{energy dissipation identity}
\begin{equation}
	\label{basic_energy_dissipation_identity}
	\energy ( x ( T ) )
	+
	\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\abs{ x' ( t ) }^{ 2 }
		+
		\abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	\dd{ t }
	= 
	\energy ( x ( 0 ) ).
\end{equation}
One could now raise the question if this identity already characterizes 
equation (\ref{gf_basic_equation}). 
But as it turns out, we can go even one step further. Namely we only ask for 
\emph{De Giorgi's optimal energy dissipation inequality} given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{basic_optimal_energy_dissipation_inequality}
	\energy ( x ( T ) )
	+
	\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\abs{ x' ( t ) }^{ 2 }
		+
		\abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	\dd{ t }
	\leq
	\energy ( x ( 0 ) ).
\end{equation}
We call this inequality optimal since as demonstrated before, we usually expect 
an equality to hold if $ x $ is a solution to (\ref{gf_basic_equation}).
Now let us assume that $ x $ satisfies inequality
(\ref{basic_optimal_energy_dissipation_inequality}) and is sufficiently regular.
Then we can estimate again by the fundamental theorem of calculus that
\begin{align*}
	& \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\abs{
			\nabla \energy ( x ( t ) )
			+
			x' ( t ) 
		}^{ 2 }
	\dd{ t }
	\\
	={} &
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\inner*{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }{ x' ( t ) }
	\dd{ t }
	+
	\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\abs{ x' ( t ) }^{ 2 }
		+
		\abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	\dd{ t }
	\\
	={} &
	\energy ( x ( T ) ) - \energy ( x ( 0 ) ) 
	+
	\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int_{ 0 }^{ T }
		\abs{ x' ( t ) }^{ 2 }
		+
		\abs{ \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) }^{ 2 }
	\dd{ t }
	\leq 0.
\end{align*}
Since we started with an integral over a non-negative function, this implies 
that for almost every time $ t $, we have that $ x' ( t ) = - \nabla \energy ( 
x ( t ) ) $. But if $ x $ and $ E $ are sufficiently regular, this already 
implies that $ x' ( t ) = - \nabla \energy ( x ( t ) ) $ holds for all times $ 
t 
$.
Thus $ x $ is a gradient flow of 
the energy $ \energy $.

The real strength of formulating the differential equation 
(\ref{gf_basic_equation}) via inequality 
(\ref{basic_optimal_energy_dissipation_inequality}) becomes clear if we want to 
consider gradient flows in a more complicated setting. In order to formulate 
equation (\ref{gf_basic_equation}), we need to have a notion of differentiation 
and a gradient in the target of $ x $. Therefore we may use pre-Hilbert spaces 
or smooth Riemannian manifolds as suitable substitutes for $ \mathbb{ R }^{ N 
} $. 

Examples for such more complicated gradient flows include the heat equation, 
which can be written as the $ \lp^{ 2 } $-gradient flow of the Dirichlet 
energy. 
Further examples include  
the Fokker-Planck equation, the Allen--Cahn equation and mean curvature flow. 
The two latter of course play a key role for us.
\begin{comment}
A first example for a generalization is therefore the heat equation $ \partial_{ t } u - \Delta u = 0 $ for some open and bounded set $ \Omega $. As our space, we shall take $ \mathrm{ H }_{ 0 }^{ 1 } ( \Omega ) $ equipped with the inner product
\begin{equation*}
	\inner*{ u }{ v }
	\coloneqq
	\int
		\inner*{ u }{ v }
	\dd{ x }.
\end{equation*}
Our energy is given by the Dirichlet functional
\begin{equation*}
	\energy ( u ) \coloneqq
	\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }
	\int
		\abs{ \nabla u }^{ 2 }
	\dd{ x }
\end{equation*}
Then we can compute that at least on $ \mathrm{ H }_{ 0 }^{ 1 } \cap \mathrm{ H }^{ 2 } ( \Omega ) $, the Fréchet derivative of $ \energy $ is given by $ \diff ( E ) ( u ) [ v ] = - \int \Delta u v \dd{ x } $.
