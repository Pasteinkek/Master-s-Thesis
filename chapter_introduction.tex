\chapter{Introduction}

Multiphase mean curvature is an important geometric evolution equation which 
has been studied for a long time, bearing not only mathematical importance, but 
also for the applied sciences. Originally it was proposed to study the 
evolution of grain boundaries in annealed recrystallized metal, as described by 
(BECK 1952 IN SO NEM JOURNAL, zitiert von MULLINS) and (MULLINS 1956 zitiert 
von tim in ls17).
Over the years a number of different solution concepts for multiphase mean 
curvature flow have been proposed. Classically we have smooth solutions, where 
we require the evolution of sets to be smooth (HIER GUTE QUELLE EINFÃœGEN).
Brakke and Keneth describes in their book 
\cite{brakke_kenneth_motion_of_surface_by_mean_curvature} the motion by mean 
curvature using varifolds. Luckhaus and Sturzenhecker introduced a 
distributional solution to mean curvature flow in their work 
\cite{luckhaus_sturzenhecker_implicit_time_discretization_for_mcf}. Another 
solution concept is a viscosity solution concept
